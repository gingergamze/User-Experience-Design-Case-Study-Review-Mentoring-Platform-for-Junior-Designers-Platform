Abstract

The biggest problem for entry-level designers is the lack of experience.
With the evolution of technology, junior designers interact through platforms 
where they can connect to mentors and get feedback on their user experience (UX) projects. 
An experimental mentoring platform that provide UX case study review sessions, can have impacts 
on building better portfolios and confidence for junior UX designers while job seeking. 
This research represents the UX designer graduatesâ€™ struggles when they are creating case studies
for their portfolios. With the advantages of a digital platform using a text similarity algorithm feature, 
online mentoring sessions notes for the UX design field became more goal oriented and beneficial not only
for the one mentee but also for the other junior designers. Insights from the several user interviews and 
usability tests shaped the user experience design for creating a data-driven mentoring platform. 
As a result, new graduates or junior UX designers had more opportunities to improve their case studies 
in their portfolios by receiving useful UX tips from the platform library and in return they could submit 
their session notes which can help other mentees in similar case studies. 

Key words: Mentoring Platforms, UX Case Study Reviews, Text Similarity, Data Driven UX
